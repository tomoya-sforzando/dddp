- [Kedro](https://github.com/quantumblacklabs/kedro)
  - > Kedro is an open-source Python framework that applies software engineering best-practice to data and machine-learning pipelines.You can use it, for example, to optimise the process of taking a machine learning model into a production environment.You can use Kedro to organise a single user project running on a local environment, or collaborate within a team on an enterprise-level project.

- [Metaflow](https://github.com/Netflix/metaflow)
  - > Metaflow is a human-friendly Python/R library that helps scientists and engineers build and manage real-life data science projects. Metaflow was originally developed at Netflix to boost productivity of data scientists who work on a wide variety of projects from classical statistics to state-of-the-art deep learning.
- [Databolt Flow](https://github.com/d6t/d6tflow)
  - > Python library for building highly effective data science workflows. For data scientists and data engineers, d6tflow is a python library which makes building complex data science workflows easy, fast and intuitive. It is built on top of workflow manager luigi but unlike luigi it is optimized for data science workflows.
- [Steppy](https://github.com/minerva-ml/steppy)
  - > Steppy is a lightweight, open-source, Python 3 library for fast and reproducible experimentation. Steppy lets data scientist focus on data science, not on software development issues. Steppy's minimal interface does not impose constraints, however, enables clean machine learning pipeline design.
- [Sacred](https://github.com/IDSIA/sacred)
  - > Sacred is a tool to help you configure, organize, log and reproduce experiments developed at IDSIA.
